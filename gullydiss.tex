This work would not have been possible without the mentorship of my collaborators Katelyn Allers and Alycia Weinberger, for which I am deeply indebted.  I acknowledge the mentorship and patience of my former student colleagues Dr. Jasmina Marsh and Dr. Casey Deen.  I am grateful for the efforts of my junior colleagues Jared Rand, Amanda Turbyfill, and Carleen Boyer for their contributions to the Silicon Diffractive Optics Group.  Engineers Weisong Wang and Cindy Brooks contributed substantially to the Si diffractive optics fabrication.  I am indebted to my NASA GRSP mentor Daniel Wilson, with whom it was a pleasure to work.  I am thankful for the supervision of Richard Muller and Victor White at the Microdevices Laboratory.  

I am delighted to acknowledge support from the NASA Graduate Student Research Program (GSRP) Fellowship, grant NNX10AK82H.  Portions of this research were supported by NASA APRA grant NNX10AC68G, NASA ACT grant NNX12AC31G, NSF ATI grant AST-0705064, and NASA Origins grant number NNX07AI83G.  MGS acknowledges support from the University of Texas in the form of the Graduate Dean's Prestigious Fellowship and from the Department of Astronomy in the form of the David Benfield Memorial Fellowship in Astronomy.  Funding from the McDonald Observatory and the Department of Astronomy's Cox graduate student excellence funds have helped to support travel and other aspects of this research.  Part of the research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Some of the work was carried out at the University of Texas under a contract from the University of Arizona.  The development work for the grisms was supported in part by NASA (grant number NNX07AV15H).  The authors wish to thank Gary Poczulp and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory for assistance in producing some interferograms of early grating prototypes.  This dissertation includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

%I was lucky to be part of such a talented and creative group of incoming graduate students.  Thank you to all the friendly, funny, and courageous people of Austin I met along the way---too numerous to identify---for contributing to my prosperity here.  And of course thank you to my family and friends.

A very special thank you is reserved for my advisor, Daniel Jaffe, for contributing so deeply to my professional growth.  In particular I acknowledge his patient editing of the prose in this document.

I summarize the optical design, fabrication, and performance of silicon diffractive optics for astronomical spectrographs.  The first set of optical devices includes diffraction-limited, high-throughput silicon grisms for JWST-NIRCam.  These grisms served as pathfinders to Silicon immersion gratings, which offer size and cost savings for high-resolution near-infrared spectrographs.  I demonstrate the production and optical evaluation of the immersion grating that enabled IGRINS at the McDonald Observatory.  This grating provides spectral resolution $R=40,000$ over the $H-$ and $K-$ near-infrared band atmospheric windows (1.5$-$2.5 $\mu$m).  Electron-beam lithography offers much higher precision over contact mask photolithography for the production of Si immersion gratings.  Using electron-beam lithography, I designed, fabricated, and tested diffraction-limited Si immersion gratings over a 30 $\times$ 100 mm beam.  These prototypes are stepping stones to monolithic Si gratings for iSHELL and GMTNIRS.  The monolithic design of Si immersion gratings presents a limitation for scaling up the grating size, since existing fabrication equipment cannot handle monolithic silicon pucks.  The size limitation can be overcome by direct-bonding Si substrates to optical prisms.  I demonstrate a technique to measure interfacial gaps as small as 14 nm between the bonding interface, which produces 0.2\% transmission loss.  These technologies will enable the direct measurement of the atmospheric properties of extrasolar planets in the next decade.  

The lowest mass objects in nearby star forming regions now accessible to spectroscopy are in the sub-brown dwarf regime, with estimated masses comparable to the masses of extrasolar planets and bordering the threshold of opacity limited fragmentation.  We confirm and characterize, using $R\sim 2000$ near-infrared spectroscopy, 17 candidate young substellar objects in nearby star forming regions.  Using deep optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry, I search an off-core region of the nearby $\sim1 Myr$ \emph{Ophiuchus} star forming cluster for candidate young stars and brown dwarfs.  Multi-object $I-$band spectroscopy of 419 candidates reveals 12 new young stars and brown dwarfs.  Ten of these have no evidence for mid-IR emission from 3.6 to 8.0 $\mu$m.  The other two are indicative of edge-on disks, based on their mid-infrared slopes rising with wavelength.  The disk fraction for spectral types M4 and later towards this region of \emph{Ophiuchus} is 33\%, lower than the typical disk fraction of $1-3$ Myr clusters.

Michael Gully-Santiago was born in Boston, and attended high school in Norwell Massachusetts.  He matriculated at Boston University in 2003, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Astronomy \& Physics in May 2007.  During his undergraduate years he worked at the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas and the Clay Center Observatory in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he remained as a faculty member until 2008.  He enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin Department of Astronomy's Graduate Program in August 2008.  In 2010 he was awarded the NASA Graduate Student Research Program fellowship, which enabled him to work at the NASA JPL Microdevices Laboratory in Pasadena, CA.
